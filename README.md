# Madlibs Project #1 

Teach a Celebrity Something - MADLIBS 

(https://youtu.be/yUWxEXA-IQY)

This was my FIRST attempt ever at a MadLibs project in Python.

I DID NOT use a tutorial and had no prior experience before this. 

I plan to make a better version of this soon that is more polished. 

To run the game, you need to open the madlibs.exe file OR navigate to the folder where the .py file is, open in terminal, and 
enter "py madlibs.py", which should run the code. 

Try to make your answers as silly as possible for the best results!
