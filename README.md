# Madlibs Project #1 

Just a silly project I did for Youtube

Hey, this is Alyssa, the person who made the game. 

In case you are unaware, this project was my FIRST attempt ever at a MadLibs project in Python.
I DID NOT use a tutorial, so the code is messy. 

Just for fun, I have included my python project if you want to look at the code yourself. 
It's not really worth stealing, to be honest, but it might be fun to laugh at. 

Please be kind! 

I am aware of the gramatical errors (mostly spacing and quotations missing) but I plan to make a better version of this soon that is more polished. 

To run the game, you need to open the madlibs.exe file. I have no idea if the computer will think it's a virus or not, but seriously. It's FINE.
