# Madlibs 



VERSION 0.2: 
I made another go at this madlibs creation thing and tried to add considerations for fruit types like changing 'blueberrys' to 'blueberries' in case
that choice was made. However, the first princess' name doesn't cover that problem despite my best efforts. Either way, it was fun to write another
silly story. I hope you enjoy. Do keep in mind I am still learning and with each new version of this I make, I hope it's a little better than the one before. 

Also, I am going to be released a narrated version of this madlibs on YouTube soon with ai generated images. I will link it here when ready.

VERSION 0.1: 
This was my FIRST attempt ever at a MadLibs project in Python.

I DID NOT use a tutorial and had no prior experience before this. 


I made a funny video about it, if you want to watch:

I plan to make a better version of this soon that is more polished. 

To run the game, you need to open the madlibs.exe file OR navigate to the folder where the .py file is, open in terminal, and 
enter "py madlibs.py", which should run the code. 

Try to make your answers as silly as possible for the best results!
